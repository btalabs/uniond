Created for the Consensus 2016 Hackathon.

NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS NOT READY FOR DEPLOYMENT.

#What is UnionD?

We are trying to systemise the organising of groups of people sharing common skills and interests. Guilds, co-operatives and friendly societies share many of these ideas which until now have not been formalised in code.

The problem we are trying to solve; how to facilitate collective agreement in a meaningful way that resolves the financial and political issues that arise.

We are not trying to put exisiting unions into code, we are trying to facilitate new types of co-operation and collective action.

As labour markets become horizontal and people sell their skills in the marketplace outside of traditional corporate structures, there is a need for collective organising of such skills and interests.

Unions as they exist today are often forced into arbitrary membership structures based on workplace or employer commonality. UnionD allows people to come together based on skills and interests (as well as traditional workplace commonality).

#Roles

##Member(s)

Persons who join together for a common purpose.

##MemberAdmin(s)

Members who have the power to add new members to the UnionD.

##Treasurer(s)

Members who have the power to spend UnionD funds (ether).

#Processes

##Constitution (settings)

The parameters of the UnionD. Changeable by super-majority vote.

##Issues

Any member can create an issue. Issues are determined by Flux mechanics, developed by @Xetrov. Eg. If there are 10 issues, you get 10 votes, you can vote 10 times on the issue you care most about, or transfer your votes to another party.

##Spending

Treasurer(s) can spend funds belonging to the UnionD. Funds are collected through dues paid by the members and by the profitable activies of the UnionD. If there are multiple treasurers, spending is by a super-majority (multi-sig).

##Elections

Any member can create an election. Elections are for special roles. Default setting is by a simple majority (50% + 1 vote).

##Ammendments

Any member can propose to change the settings or constitution. Ammendments are passed by a super majority (2/3 popular vote).

##Commerce

UnionD issues its own currency. The  purpose of this currency is to incentivise behaviours which are in the interests of the UnionD. Currency is issued to members each time they renew their subscription. This fiat currency can be used to purchase goods and services from anyone who recognises the value of the particular UnionD.
