#What is UnionD?

We are trying to systemise the organising of groups of people sharing common skills and interests. Guilds, co-operatives and friendly societies share many of these ideas which until now have not been formalised in code.

The problem we are trying to solve; how to facilitate collective agreement in a meaningful way that resolves the financial and political issues that arise.

We are not trying to put exisiting unions into code, we are trying to facilitate new types of co-operation and collective action.
